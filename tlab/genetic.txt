1. Initialize population:
   - Randomly generate a population of solutions within the solution space.

2. For each generation from 1 to the specified number of generations:
   a. Calculate fitness:
      - Evaluate the fitness of each solution based on the objective function.

   b. Selection:
      - Select parents based on fitness proportionate selection.

   c. Crossover and mutation:
      - Perform crossover and mutation to generate offspring from selected parents.

   d. Combine parents and offspring:
      - Combine the parents and offspring to form the next generation.

   e. Select top individuals:
      - Select the top individuals from the combined population for the next generation based on fitness.

   f. Print best fitness:
      - Print the best fitness value achieved in the current generation.

3. Termination:
   - After the specified number of generations, terminate the algorithm.

4. Select optimal solution:
   - Select the solution with the highest fitness from the final population as the optimal solution.

5. Output:
   - Print the optimal solution and its fitness.
